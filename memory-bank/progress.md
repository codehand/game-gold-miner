# Progress

## Status Summary

**Phase:** Implementation Plan Step 1 complete and validated. Step 2 is blocked pending explicit user authorization. No runnable game exists yet.

## Completed

- Reference video reviewed and its visible gameplay elements documented.
- Simple GDD created in `memory-bank/game-design-document.md`.
- MVP scope and explicit exclusions defined.
- Technical stack and planned architecture documented in `memory-bank/tech-stack.md`.
- Repository contribution rules documented in `AGENTS.md`.
- Six core Memory Bank files initialized.
- Required pre-code document checks and database-schema documentation rules established.
- Detailed base-game implementation plan created with validation for every step.
- GDD, tech stack, and implementation plan moved into `memory-bank/`; related links and base-game decisions updated.
- Architecture documentation workflow added; the file began as an empty placeholder and is now maintained as the architecture map.
- Step 1 completed on 2026-08-27: all Memory Bank files and `AGENTS.md` were reviewed; the base-game boundary was confirmed; the repository was verified as documentation-only; no package manifest, source tree, database, migration, or schema was found.
- `memory-bank/architecture.md` populated with current document responsibilities, planned runtime-module ownership, dependency boundaries, data flow, and the explicit `none` database schema.

## Implementation Step Status

| Step | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Scope and repository state | Complete | Documentation reviewed; scope consistent; repository and database checks passed. |
| 2 — Scaffold the web application | Not started / blocked | Requires explicit user authorization after the Step 1 stop gate. |

## Not Started

- Vite/TypeScript/Phaser scaffold and dependency installation.
- Package scripts, linting, type checking, Vitest, and Playwright configuration.
- Pure simulation/economy implementation.
- Phaser mine scene, four floors, miners, transport, warehouse, and UI.
- Base-game shaft/elevator/warehouse upgrades and floor unlocks.
- Expanded manager, boost, and gift-drop systems after the base milestone.
- Save schema, migrations, IndexedDB persistence, and offline income.
- Original art, sprite atlases, audio, and visual polish.
- Mobile performance, responsive layout, and Telegram integration testing.
- Deployment pipeline.

## Acceptance Targets

- The production chain is understandable within 30 seconds.
- Four floors animate concurrently at 60 FPS on target mobile hardware.
- A player can open at least three floors and reach a multiplier milestone within ten minutes.
- Save restoration and capped offline income are deterministic and tested.
- The economy cannot enter an unrecoverable progression stall.

## Known Risks

- The reference clip is too short to establish exact formulas or all features.
- Idle-game number growth can overflow without a large-number abstraction.
- WebView suspension and clock manipulation can corrupt offline rewards if not bounded and validated.
- Visual fidelity must not rely on copied art, audio, branding, or UI assets.
